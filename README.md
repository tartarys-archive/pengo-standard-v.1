Pengo Standard - a cultural digital issuance model based on physical deposits, NFT witnessing and community ethics.
# Pengo Standard (v1)

**Pengo** is a cultural and ethical digital standard designed to issue value only through verified physical or intellectual deposits, publicly witnessed by the community.

This repository documents the **Pengo Standard v1**, an open, community-governed framework for culturally grounded digital issuance.

## Abstract

Modern digital tokens are often created without origin, memory, or responsibility.

The Pengo Standard proposes a different path.

Pengo jetons are issued **only** when a real-world cultural or intellectual artifact is placed under custodial protection, publicly witnessed on-chain, and acknowledged by the community.

Value does not precede meaning.  
Value follows testimony.

## Core Model

Pengo issuance follows a mandatory three-layer structure:

**Physical Deposit → NFT Witness → Pengo Jeton**

### 1. Physical Deposit  
A tangible or intellectual cultural artifact accepted into custodial protection by the Tartarys Treasury (Gondnokság).

### 2. NFT Witness  
A non-transferable or purpose-bound NFT that publicly attests the deposit’s acceptance and preserves collective memory.

### 3. Pengo Jeton  
A transferable digital unit representing abstract, community-recognized value — **not ownership**, **not a claim**, **not a promise of redemption**.

No layer may exist without the previous one.

## What Pengo Is Not

- Pengo is **not** a security  
- Pengo is **not** backed by legal ownership  
- Pengo is **not** redeemable for the deposited artifact  
- Pengo is **not** issued arbitrarily  

Pengo is a **signal**, not a contract.

---

## Ethical Foundation

Pengo relies on:
- community witnessing instead of enforcement,
- transparency instead of coercion,
- reputation instead of litigation.

Misuse is addressed through public ethical processes (e.g. Yellow / Black Notice models), not courts.

---

## Governance

The Pengo Standard is maintained under community guardianship within the Tartarys ecosystem.

- No patents are claimed.
- No exclusive ownership exists.
- Revisions occur through documented community consensus.

---

## Status

- **Version:** v1 (Foundational)
- **Stability:** Conceptually stable, implementation-agnostic
- **Next Steps:**  
  - v2: tokenomics extensions  
  - smart contract reference implementations  
  - community tooling
